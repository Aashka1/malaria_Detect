Malaria Detection Using CNN
Overview
This project focuses on the detection of malaria-infected cells using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is built using TensorFlow and trained on a dataset of cell images to classify whether a cell is infected or uninfected. The project leverages deep learning techniques to automate and speed up the detection process, which can aid in early diagnosis and treatment.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of cell images categorized into two classes:

Parasitized: Images of cells infected with the Plasmodium parasite.
Uninfected: Images of healthy cells.
You can download the dataset from Kaggle Malaria Cell Images Dataset.

Model Architecture
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture used in this project includes:

Convolutional layers: Extract spatial features from the input images.
MaxPooling layers: Reduce the dimensionality of the features.
Fully Connected layers: Classify the images into infected or uninfected categories.
Key layers:

2D Convolution (filters: 32, 64)
Max Pooling
Dense Layer (128 units)
Dropout (0.5)
Output Layer (Softmax activation for binary classification)
Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Aashka1/malaria_Detect.git
cd malaria_Detect
Install dependencies:
You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Main Libraries:

TensorFlow
scikit-learn
NumPy
Matplotlib
Usage
Train the Model:
Prepare the dataset: Ensure the dataset is organized in train and test directories with subfolders for Parasitized and Uninfected images.

Run the training script:

python train.py
This script will train the CNN model and save the trained model to a file (e.g., malaria_model.h5).

Test the Model:
You can test the trained model on unseen data:
python test.py
This script will load the trained model and output accuracy metrics for the test dataset.

Predict New Images:
To predict whether a given cell image is infected or not:


python predict.py --image <cellimages>
Results
After training, the CNN model achieved the following results:

Accuracy: ~85%
Precision: 0.83
Recall: 0.86
These metrics indicate that the model performs well in distinguishing between infected and uninfected cells.
